/* was hoping to have a clock that incremented at the bottom for my cheesy footer.  This is what Ii came up with on my own (but doesnt stop at 60sec).  I am also pretty bad at "this" keyword - I barely understand it - it's for scoping document vs window, right (?) I never have to use it so I've mostly forgotten it even exists (Not to mention, it's a major pain in the ass).

// this.tick = 1;
// this.count = 0;
// const secFunc = (count, tick, secTarget) => {

// 		this.count = parseFloat(this.tick++ / 100)
// 			.toFixed(2)
// 			.slice(2, 4);
// 		this.secTarget.innerText = this.count;
// 		// return count;

https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/reset-starting-time/256511 , but it decrements instead of increments, so not what I was looking for - unfortunately too inexperienced to figure out how to reverse it (!)  started at it until I was like damn, I'd better do my other work before I spend any more time on this (was challenging to stop, I was definitely in the zone)...
