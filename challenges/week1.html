		<p>
			Inside the HTML section of this Codepen is the code for a Bootstrap
			container with three rows, each currently containing three columns of
			equal width. This Bootstrap container is visible above.
		</p>
		<p></p>

		<p>
			There is a CSS style applied so that you can see the outline of each
			column in green, just as a visual aid. The size of your current viewport
			is also displayed, so that you can easily see when you are hitting certain
			breakpoints. To change the viewport size, you can resize the width of the
			Result section/resize your browser. (It is not recommended to use the
			browser developer tools to change the viewport for this challenge; it will
			not work well with the Codepen display.)
		</p>

		<p>
			Hint: The Codepen linked
			<a
				href="https://codepen.io/minae/pen/BaaNEmP?editors=1000"
				target="_blank"
				>here</a
			>
			contains a small demo that can help you with this challenge.
		</p>

		<h3>Your Challenge:</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Make sure that you are logged into your Codepen account, or create a
				Codepen account if you have not already. Use the "Fork" button in the
				lower right of your screen to create a copy of this code for your own
				use. Do not edit the original Codepen, as you will not be able to save
				your edits.
			</li>
			<li>
				Edit the classes for the columns in the first row so that when the
				viewport is SM and up (576px or higher), the columns with the words
				"One" and "Two" inside them each span across two (of the 12 possible)
				columns for their row and the "Three" column spans across the remaining
				columns for the same row. For viewports below size SM, the three columns
				should remain of equal width.
			</li>
			<li>
				Edit the classes for the columns in the second row so that when the
				viewport is size MD and up (768px or higher) the column with the word
				'Five' inside it spans across 50% of its row (i.e. spans 6 columns), and
				the columns for 'Four' and 'Six' span across the remaining columns
				equally (so they both take up 25% each). For viewports that are below
				size MD, the three columns should remain of equal width.
			</li>
			<li>
				Edit the classes for the columns in the third row so that when the
				viewport is size LG and up (992 px and higher), the columns remain at
				equal width as they are now, but for sizes below LG, the columns stack
				on top of each other.
			</li>
			<li>
				Submit the URL of your forked version of this Codepen as your answer to
				this Code Challenge in the Nucamp learning portal.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			You will only need to change code in the HTML section to complete this
			challenge, not the CSS or JS sections.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will not be graded on this challenge. It will be used for class
			discussion and knowledge assessment. Please submit your attempt before
			your Saturday workshop, even if it's not working completely.
		</p>
