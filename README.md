#### 🔥🔥🔥 HTML / Bootstrap / jQuery instructional project 📚 for [nucamp.co coding bootcamp](nucamp.co)

This is an instructional project from a coding bootcamp I completed.  This particular project was to learn bootstrap's `css` library, some of its `jQuery` plugins, go a little deeper into the surface of `jQuery`, and of course work with `HTML`.  It also helped me work more deeply with `git` and `gh-cli`, as I have 😰 painstakingly committed 💦 and pushed each segment, created a branch for a workaround, and even changed the `origin` from `master` to `main`.

It's already stuff I mostly knew (`HTML`, the bootstrap `class`es, and `css`), but I still felt like I got a lot out of it, since I went back over these technologies with a fine-toothed comb. I used the opportuntiy to learn more about online accessibility:  things like 🐕‍🦺👩‍🦯 aria labels ♿ & screen reader tags, 🦯
`HTML` outline tags (`<main />` `<header />` `<footer />` `<section />` `<hgroup />`) It was also nice to have some accountability for projects, deadlines, and be required to collaborate after only coding by myself for the last two years

To demo (`node 14 LTS` recommended):

```
git clone (this repo)

cd nucampsite

npm i

npm run build

npm i -g serve dist

serve dist

{ open browser as instructed }
```


One thing that was totally new 👶 to me was ol'`jQuery`  - not that I anticipate there will be a big growth in the `jQuery` job market any time soon, ⏰ but it's good to know how it works under the hood in case someone needs me to support a 👴 legacy site 👵 that uses it at some point. I'm sure there will be a lot of work doing migration *away* 🦅🕊 from `jQuery`, too, for which one would have to know how it works to be able to reconstruct its features in a more modern library, which right now would be ☢`React`-based, but who knows, this stuff moves so fast, it could be something completely different in a year or two... 

The class was very good at introducing some basic experience with `jQuery`,  learning how it works generally, and then, like with anything, one can read more about it if thery're so interested - and I do that with just about everything, so I definitely went down some `jQuery` rabbit holes... 🐰 not to mention learning about legacy JS module 📦camping frameworks, like `RequireJS`, `CommonJS`, `UMD`, `AMD`, `SystemJS`/`JSPM` and `ES`, which weren't part of the subject material, but I had been interested in learning more about how people used to load modules for similar front-end projects outside of `cjs`/`NodejS`/`npm` and `ES` 🤓

I'm all for the fancy new 🏎 `CSS-in-JS` `React` SPAs, but not everyone gets to work with the newest stuff all the time, so I'm glad to get some more experience with technologies that, while not very cutting 🔪 edge, they are deeply embedded in a large share of the current online 📱 landscape. 🗻 So here's to being "forced" 🤳 to learn about old stuff again!  If nothing else, the perspective has made me very appreciative of how much easier development environments are to work with now, and very optimistic about where they're headed in the future...
